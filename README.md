# Orbi-s-form-filler
Solve the ITLA's students problem of having to fill forms up every end of a quarter using Python and Selenium libraries, with some JavaScript.
First of all, you'll need to download the python interpreter in its last version. Here's the link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.4/python-3.9.4-amd64.exe
Then you'll need to download the Selenium librarie. You can do it easily opening a cmd, and write: python -m pip install selenium
Lastly you'll have to download your browser's driver. In this case I'm using Edge so here's the download link: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/ the last stable version.
So you're ready to open the script, double click the "test2.py" file.
